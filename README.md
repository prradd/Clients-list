# Clients-list

MERN assignment i've got before job interview - make a Full-stack app for clients list for the company.
The brief was good and i saw here an opportunity to learn important technology (TypeScript) and common modules in <b>NodeJS</b> and <b>ReactJS</b> - <b>Express, Mongoose, Redux.</b>

Live sample of the project, can be found <a href="https://stormy-retreat-20506.herokuapp.com/">HERE</a>.
